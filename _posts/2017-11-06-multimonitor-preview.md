![Preview: New theme and multimonitor support]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/multimonitor-nightly.png){:.post-banner}

We've just merged initial multimonitor support to our dev-branch!

<!--more-->
For now, you just can have up to six monitors and use them to have individual sing screens for every player (as you can see in attached screenshot). More exiting features will come in future, but if you like, you can test this current state in our latest nightly.  
There are some more new things in our [current nightly]({{site.baseurl}}/#download): A new theme, called genius, and a small rating bar for every player that shows how good he or she is currently singing.
We've got some bug reports for our latest stable version, so we're currently preparing a bugfix version...

As you can see: There is much to do - Stay tuned.
