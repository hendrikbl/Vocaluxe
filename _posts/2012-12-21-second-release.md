Dear Vocaluxe fans,

we've finished Vocaluxe v0.2 after 8 months of development.  
<!--more-->

The new version has the following new features:

* Support for up to 6 microphones.
* Medley mode
* Short Song mode (short version of a song)
* Playlists: Create, Save, Edit by keyboard or mouse (drag&drop). You can adjust the sing mode for each song of the playlist individually (normal, medley, duet, short song).
<!--more-big-->
* Introduced popup controls. You can control the background music by a control panel that appears at the top border of the screen if you press <kbd>TAB</kbd> or reaches it by mouse. You can even start singing of the currently played background song.
* Webcam support:  
    * Activating/deactivating by pressing <kbd>W</kbd> in the sing screen.
    * You can use your WebCam to take profile pictures in the profile screen. Activate your camera before you start the program. If Vocaluxe detects the camera a button "Webcam" appears in the profile screen.
* WiiMote support:  
    * Vocaluxe supports the Wiimotion remote control from Nintendo. Connect it with your bluetooth connection manager and start Vocaluxe. If a Wiimote is recognized it will perform two short rumbles and the third LED will lighten up.
* Improved keyboard navigation
* Improved mouse navigation
* Improved pitch recognition
* You can specify the duet singer names in the song `.txt` by #P1 and #P2. Afterwards you can assign that names to the players in die name selection screen.
