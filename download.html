We provide portable versions of Vocaluxe for every release. If you want to try
our stable release, you could also use our installer. If you're on Linux,
you need to [compile Vocaluxe yourself](https://github.com/Vocaluxe/Vocaluxe/blob/develop/HowToBuildLinux.md)
(for advanced users, no official support).

If you're looking for some older versions, check out our releases on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Vocaluxe/Vocaluxe/releases) and
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vocaluxe/files/?source=directory).
